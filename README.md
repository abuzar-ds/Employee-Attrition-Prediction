# 📌 Predicting Employee Attrition using Random Forest

This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting employee attrition using a supervised machine learning approach. By analyzing key HR metrics, we aim to identify the most influential factors that lead to employee turnover.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a predictive model that determines whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on factors such as:

- Job Satisfaction  
- Workload  
- Overtime  
- Years at Company  
- Promotion History  
- And other key HR features

## 🛠️ Key Skills & Tools Used

- **Feature Engineering**: Workload Score, Promotion Delay, etc.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, one-hot encoding, scaling  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)  
- **EDA**: Visual analysis of feature distributions and correlations  
- **Model Building**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **Model Evaluation**: Achieved **ROC-AUC Score: 1.0**

## 📊 Results

- The model achieved **100% ROC-AUC**, indicating excellent classification performance.
- Identified key drivers of attrition using feature importance analysis.
- Provides actionable insights for HR departments to proactively address employee turnover.
